RETROSPECTIVE (Team 01)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
  > 4 vs 4 (stories)
- Total points committed vs. done 
  > 19 vs 19 (story points)
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)
  > 95h 30m vs 

**Remember**
 a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _Uncategorized_   |    15    |   -    | 52 h 45m        |             |
| 6    |   10     |   5     | 11 h 30 m      |           | 
| 7    |    7    |    8   |  9 h 15 m    |          |  
| 8   |  9      |   3    |  10 h     |    10 h       | 
| 9   |    10    |   3    |   12 h       |           | 


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

|            | Mean | StDev |
|------------|------|-------|
| Estimation |     |      | 
| Actual     |   |     |

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1 = **0.43%**

    $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$
    
- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n = **6.02%**

    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing and Integration Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 
    > 7 h
  - Total hours spent
    > 7 h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
    > 153 tests
  - Coverage
    > 96 % lines coverage
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
    > 
  - Total hours spent
    > 
  - Nr of test cases
    >  
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
    > 
  - Total hours spent
    >
