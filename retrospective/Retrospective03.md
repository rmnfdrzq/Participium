TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done :
- Total points committed vs done :
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) :

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |    -   |            |              |
| n      |         |        |            |              |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted: Highest severity, shortest time
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

We did not have enough time to do all the expected meetings. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

Our model for explaining new technologies worked well, doing a meeting with the person that took the task to implement new things instead of having individual study hours. 
We need to assign more hours to refactoring beacause we underestimated the size and complexity of the code and the impact of new changes

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

We managed to set deadlines to end the code part a few days before the demo, leaving more time for testing and code review.
We estimated better times for each task taking into account who would execute it
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

 There were no unachieved goals

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

For the next sprint we shold allocate more hours in code refactoring tasks
Keep working with deadlines in mind to ensure code is finished early to allow more time for testing and review

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We managed to follow the established deadlines in time and finished all the stories
