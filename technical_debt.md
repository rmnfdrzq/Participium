# Technical Debt Management Strategy

To effectively manage technical debt within this project, we will adopt a prioritization-based approach. 
All identified issues will be evaluated and ordered based on two primary criteria:

1. **Impact** – The degree to which the issue affects system stability, performance, maintainability, or user experience.
2. **Effort** – The estimated amount of work required to address the issue.

Priority will be given to issues with **higher impact** and **lower effort**, as these provide the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. 
This approach aims to reduce the most critical technical risks early on while ensuring efficient use of development resources.

Regular reviews of the technical debt backlog will be conducted to ensure prioritization remains aligned with project goals and evolving requirements.
